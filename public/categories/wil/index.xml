      <description>PlanningWhen getting started with a new project, researching your question and what other people have done is helpful in the beginning stages. There is a balance that needs to be found, however. Doing enough research that you know roughly what to expect but not so much that you never start. Maybe I struck that balance for a beginner. Often, you find better solutions or better questions to issues that you may have while working.</description>

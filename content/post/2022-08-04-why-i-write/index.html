<h2>Looking Back</h2>
<p>When looking back at my life thus far, I would say that I think <em>way</em> too much. I’m not quite sure where it comes from and it has been hard to enjoy life to some extent. For example, I am very careful. I have yet to go to the hospital for anything other than to visit others that are there. I’ve never broken a bone. The most debilitating thing is that I am painfully aware of imperfections that I have which has made learning from failures and mistakes more difficult. I am working to change my attitudes, however.</p>
<p>As a kid, and even now as an adult, I loved building LEGO sets to see how the builders implement the different features on the box. I liked taking apart pens to see the little mechanisms work together to push the pen out and pull it back in.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I became fascinated with how combustion engines work. I think knowing how the human heart pumps blood throughout the body is important for everyone to know. Making connections between subjects in college has also been helpful for me to learn how to apply skills learned in classes into real life and jobs that I may have. It seems that I am a passive observer and connector of things.</p>

<h2>StrengthsFinder</h2>
<p>In Spring Semester of 2020 at BYU-Idaho, I took a class called Organizational Leadership. As part of the books for the class, we were asked to get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/StrengthsFinder-2-0-Tom-Rath/dp/159562015X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=clifton+strengthsfinder+2.0+with+access+code&amp;qid=1659641324&amp;sprefix=strengthsfinder%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-1">StrengthsFinder 2.0 by Tom Rath</a>. In StrengthsFinder, there is a strengths quiz that helps the reader to find what they may be good at. At the end of the test, you are shown the top 5 strengths that you were tested to have and directed back to the book to study more. The strength that I would like to focus on is the Analytical strength.</p>
<p>While reading about the Analytical strength, this line in particular resonated with me:</p>
<p>“You want to understand how certain patterns affect one another. How do they combine? What is their outcome? Does this outcome fit with the theory being offered or the situation being confronted? These are your questions. You peel the layers back until, gradually, the root cause or causes are revealed.”</p>
<p>Let me add another question that I constantly think of, ‘How do these things fit together?’ Yes, these are my questions! This is what I want to know!</p>
<p>At the end of every explanation of a strength there is an ‘Ideas for Action’ section to help you take advantage of your new-found knowledge. These two sections really stood out to me:</p>
<p>“Your mind is constantly working and producing insightful analysis. Are other aware of that? Find the best way of expressing your thoughts: writing, one-on-one conversations, group discussions, perhaps lectures or presentations. Put value you your thoughts by communicating them.”</p>
<p>Why would anyone care what I have to say if the things that I’ve noticed are obvious? Not all the observations and connections made are obvious to everyone else. This idea had never occurred to me when I read this first section. It’s clear to me now that no one is the same as anyone else. My perspective may or may not be valuable. If I don’t share my ideas, then I’ll never know.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned that solidifying something from idea to pen and paper for example can help to develop an idea further or that process may kill the idea altogether. Hearing and thinking are very different processes. I have since become more vocal about the things that I am thinking. Usually, my sweet wife gets to listen to all the weird, seldom profound, but hopefully insightful ideas that come to my mind.</p>
<p>“Make sure that your accumulation and analysis of information always leads to its application and implementation. If you don’t do this naturally, find a partner who pushes you from theory to practice, from thinking to doing. This person will help ensure that your analysis doesn’t turn into paralysis.”</p>
<p>This is something that I still struggle with. Like I said earlier, I am still very careful. I guess I’m just cautions by nature. But this hypothetical person who can help and push me to solidify an idea or analysis would be very valuable to me. Recently, I caught myself psychoanalyzing myself and my deepest intentions and got sucked into a rabbit hole that is usually hard to crawl out of. I snapped myself out of it, recognized what I was doing, and decided to just act and move on with my life.</p>
<p>This thing has happened, what have I learned, move on. That’s it.</p>

<h2>The Point of The Blog</h2>
<p>Now, to the point of this blog. For some odd reason, I have really gravitated to typing what I think. Maybe I just like to hear the keys of the keyboard as I write my ideas. Typing may have also given me some kind of stress release or maybe relief that I no long need to hold this idea inside me anymore. There I go digressing into psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, I like typing and putting my ideas out there. I’ve never been much of a writer, but I really like the process that I have setup for myself. While some of my ideas, observations, or analyses may be wild or out there, I would just like to get them out and into a medium that is easily consumable for my own sanity. I like to share the ideas that I have with people to see what they think and get feedback. I’d like to think that even if no one knew this corner of the internet existed, I would still be writing my ideas down to try and make them productive.</p>

<h2>Conclusion, Call to Action</h2>
<p>I appreciate you if you’ve made it this far. I really do! I don’t think these ideas that I’ll share on this blog and other places are very special, but these are pieces of me and things that I have found interesting at one point to use brain power and calories to develop it. I would appreciate it if you let me know what you think. Message me on LinkedIn (at the top). Send me an email. Text or call, if you have my number. Somehow, let me know what you think and if I’m off base, which I might be, or if this was helpful or insightful at all.</p>
